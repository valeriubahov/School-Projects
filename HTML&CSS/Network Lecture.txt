Network Lecture

	What is a Network?
	
	
	Kinds of Network (stuff made of)
		
		Media (cabels wires made of coper, network card) - the stuff needed to transmit the datas between devices
		
		Typology - (the shape of network) - point to point, star, mesh, bus, Linear, Ring, Tree
			Physical - how physically the network is made (like star)
			Logical - how thing actually communicate in the shape
				you can have a star shape but locially works like a ring
		
		Protocol - Are the rules that the network need to know how to communicate.
		
		Package connect networks - packages are compressed data (0 and 1) containing all information where to go and the content
		
		You can also connect networks together, Internetworks (example INTERNET)
		
		To connect to internet you need 4 informations
			IP Address - 4 numbers going from 0 to 255 separated by a point 
			Subnet Mask: 32 bit number (255.255.255.0) 
			Gateway
			DNS
			
		TCP/IPv4 use the 32 bit version)
		IPv6 - 128 bit so we never run out of IP address
		NAT - Network Address Translation -  translate your private address to a public address
		
		TCP/IP is the set of rules/protocol used to communicate 
		
		Gateway is the connector of your network to the outside world
		
		DHCP - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
		
		APIPA - Automatic Private IP Addressing :
			It is a feature or characteristic in operating systems (eg. Windows) which enables computers to self-configure an IP address and subnet mask automatically when their 
			DHCP(Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server isn't reachable.
			
		
		
		Level of Abstraction: - Look at situation in differents way and say differents things about the same thing, also need to ignore things we don't need and concentrate on those that we do
				Are used also in IT
				
				Virtualization
				OS
				Applications
				Algorithms
				Programming languages
				Assembly Language
				Machine COde
				Architecture
				Logic Gates
				Devices
				
				All the things happening at the same time!
				
				
				
				
				OSI Model (Top to Bottom)					TCP/IP Model (Top to bottom)
				Application Layer
				Presentation Layer							Application Layer -  show the result
				Session Layer
				Transport Layer								Transport Layer - Logical Address
				Network Layer (Logical Address)				Internet Layer - Phisical address
				Data link Layer (Phisical Address - MAC)	Link Layer - convert the data into 0 and 1
				Physical layer	(voltage, etc)
		
		Transport Layer
		TCP (text) - UDP (Video, streaming)
		
		Internet Layer
